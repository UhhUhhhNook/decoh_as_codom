## Introduction

In the realm of quantum mechanics, understanding the behavior of systems under various conditions is crucial. This project aims to provide insights into how feedback mechanisms can shape the dynamics of quantum circuits. By focusing on codomain-zero, we explore the structural resistance and neutrality of quantum states. 

## Project Overview

The **Decoherence as Codomain** project integrates theoretical and experimental approaches to study open quantum systems. It employs feedback structures to examine how observer interactions affect quantum states. The project uses the concept of entropy dynamics to analyze the stability and evolution of these systems.

### Key Concepts

- **Codomain-Zero**: A structural condition where the output of a quantum system is effectively null, allowing for unique explorations of quantum behavior.
- **Entropy Dynamics**: The study of how entropy changes within quantum systems over time, particularly under feedback influences.
- **Feedback Structure**: The framework that allows for the integration of observer feedback into the dynamics of quantum circuits.

## Topics

This repository covers several key topics in quantum mechanics and circuit design:

- **Codomain-Zero**
- **Entropy Dynamics**
- **Feedback Structure**
- **Neutral State**
- **Observer Feedback**
- **Open Quantum System**
- **Piter**

## Usage

After setting up the project, you can start using the quantum circuits. The main functionalities include:

- **Simulating Quantum Circuits**: Run simulations to observe how feedback influences the state of the system.
- **Analyzing Results**: Utilize built-in tools to analyze the output and entropy dynamics of the circuits.
- **Visualizing Data**: Generate visual representations of the quantum states and their evolution over time.

### Example

Here is a simple example of how to simulate a quantum circuit:

```python
# Example code for simulating a quantum circuit
import quantum_library as ql

# Initialize the quantum circuit
circuit = ql.QuantumCircuit()

# Add gates and feedback mechanisms
circuit.add_gate('H', target=0)
circuit.add_feedback('measure', target=0)

# Run the simulation
results = circuit.run()

# Analyze results
ql.analyze(results)
```
